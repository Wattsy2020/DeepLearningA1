# DeepLearningA1
This repository contains the code for a deep learning subject's group assignment, which involved implementing a Multi Layer Perceptron and modules such as dropout and batch normalisation from scratch along with performing experiments on them.

My contribution was the entire "Algorithms/Structures" section, which defines the MLP and every layer used in it. I choose to implement all functionality as a layer class, following a similar modular approach found in Tensorflow and Pytorch. I did benefit from the testing performed by other group members in the "Experiments" section, which highlighted a few bugs and acted as a good set of unit tests to check the modules.
